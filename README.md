# Temporary ReadME

# Open|Space

Designed to be an open-source hub of information about the space industry.   
Initial project to be done in vanilla HTMl/CSS/JS, potentially upgraded to Django/Flask/Python or other frameworks as I see fit.  
Ignore all colours and main "themes" until complete, the stark contrasting and super-sized borders allows me to see easily where each component will sit.  
On-going project.

## To Do:
- Complete homepage, involve an API to gain next 5 rocket launch information
- Complete planets page. Likely re-design the entire page, present the information in an easier format
- Add rockets page. This will be a longer-term information dump. Will include widely-known rockets from history and current use.
- Add satellite tracker. Developing a page to enable tracking of satellites based on public API's, to achieve near real-time positioning
- Add rover information. Slightly influenced by "Goodnight Oppy", this will contain all rovers currently on other planets!

## Challenges

Once I get a solid idea for how I want the carousels/data dump pages to look, I want to streamline adding new information.  
Everything is currently hard coded, I'd like to change that to a database back-end with a form to input new data so it's a 1-stop shop for adding and collecting information.
