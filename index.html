        <br />
        <p>
          OpenSpace is designed to be an open-source resource of information about space exploration and it's history.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout the history of humankind, there has always been a fascination of "what's out there?" and "are we
          the only intelligent life?"<br />
          This site is not designed to answer any meaning of life or the universe, only to give you the tools to
          understand what's out there
        </p>
        <p>
          Working your way across this site, you'll learn about our local solar system, the means and ways we have of
          reaching out from our home planet and into the cosmos. You'll also learn about the incredible machines that
          we've sent to the surfaces of other planets to do scientific research and eventually to allow humans to set
          foot on them.
        </p>
        <p>
          We live in an such an incredible time frame that during your time here on Earth, we have the ability to send
          humans into orbit, robots and helicopters onto other planets and truly start to explore the wider known
          universe
        </p>
        <p>
          So please bring your excitement, wonder and natural curiosity to the front and explore the cosmos with
          OpenSpace
        </p>
